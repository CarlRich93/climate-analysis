title: Setup
---

Before we get started, there are a few requirements to meet. You will need:

* [A GitHub account](https://github.com)
* A GitHub repository titled `climate-analysis`
* A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

If you do not have a `climate-analysis` repository, you can create an empty one now. No specific contents are required for this lesson.

Once you're all set up, [we can start the course](index.html).
