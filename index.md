Academic software projects are large, complicated endeavours that require management both in order to be completed successfully, and to have a solid and sustainable impact. This workshop teaches the basics of managing project development and release, using the project management tools on the repository hosting site **GitHub** (and is applicable to repositories hosted on **GitLab**).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This workshop continues from [Version Control with Git](https://southampton-rsg.github.io/swc-git-novice/). If you have not completed that workshop, you will require a basic knowledge of **Git** and **GitHub** to take part in this workshop.
>
> **Python** is used as the example language throughout. No knowledge of **python** is required, and all tools and standards referenced have equivalents in other languages.
